# Web-Development-with-AI-ML
# Project Overview
The project involves developing a user-friendly and informative webpage for Manipal College of Dental Science to improve its online presence and accessibility. Additionally, it includes integrating machine learning algorithms into a dental diagnosis application. This integration enhances the ability to accurately detect dental diseases so that patients can know about their problem and treat accordingly. Initially a user-friendly web page is designed and implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. The backend system is then developed using python and passive aggressive classifier algorithm for prediction task. This â€˜web page ensures an efficient and effective use for predicting the disease which is helpful for people with various related teeth problems.
